Web Stack Debugging

Concepts

This project focuses on Web Stack Debugging, an essential skill for DevOps engineers and system administrators. It involves troubleshooting and resolving issues within a web stack, which includes servers, databases, load balancers, and other infrastructure components.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to debug and configure various components of a web stack to ensure optimal performance and availability. The tasks involve identifying and fixing issues related to web servers, load balancers, and permissions.

Requirements

All scripts must be written in Bash and executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Each script must start with #!/usr/bin/env bash.

The second line of each script should be a comment explaining its functionality.

Scripts must be executable and pass Shellcheck without any errors.

A README.md file is mandatory in the root of the project directory.

Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

Develop debugging skills for web servers and infrastructure.

Learn how to identify and resolve web stack issues.

Gain hands-on experience with Nginx, HAProxy, and user privilege management.

Understand process management and service debugging in Linux environments.

Tasks

Fix Nginx Port Issue: Ensure that Nginx is running and listening on port 80.

Configure HAProxy Load Balancer: Set up HAProxy to distribute traffic between multiple web servers.

Run Commands as Another User: Create a script to execute commands under a specified user account.
