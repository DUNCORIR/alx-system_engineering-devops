What it offers:

This is a comprehensive guide for learning regex from scratch. It covers all the basics like matching characters, using quantifiers, and working with groups, along with advanced concepts.
Key sections:

Characters and Character Classes: Learn how to match specific characters or groups (like digits or letters).
Anchors: Useful for matching at the beginning (^) or end ($) of strings.
Quantifiers: Help in matching a number of occurrences (*, +, {n}, etc.).
Groups and Backreferences: Group parts of a regex and refer back to them.
Starting point: Try the “Quick Start” section if you want an overview, then move into specific topics as needed.

2. W3Schools - JavaScript Regex Object
What it offers:

This is a short, focused tutorial on regex in JavaScript specifically. It explains how to use JavaScript’s RegExp object and methods like .test() and .exec() for working with regex.
Key sections:

Creating regex in JavaScript: Shows how to create regex using literals (/pattern/) or with the RegExp() constructor.
Common Methods: .test() checks for a match, .exec() retrieves the matched part.
Starting point: Begin with examples of creating regex in JavaScript, then practice with .test() to check if a pattern matches parts of a string.

3. Rubular.com
What it offers:

Rubular is an online tool specifically for experimenting with regex in Ruby. It’s a very simple platform: paste text and write regex patterns to see immediate results.
How to use it:

Type a sample text and write a regex to see matches instantly.
Adjust patterns to learn how different parts of regex work in real time.
Starting point: Try a simple match like /hello/ to match "hello" in a text, then move on to character classes or quantifiers (/hel+o/ to match "helllooo").

4. Regex101.com
What it offers:

This site is similar to Rubular but supports multiple languages: PHP, JavaScript, and Python. It’s excellent for testing regex patterns, and it even explains each part of the regex as you type it.
Key features:

Explanation Pane: Provides a breakdown of what each part of your regex does.
Flags: Options to modify the pattern, like case-insensitivity.
Match Information: Shows exact matches and capture groups.
Starting point: Start by typing a simple regex and see the explanation pane to understand each component. You can then use the tool’s “Quick Reference” to expand your knowledge.

Overall Tips
Start Simple: Try matching basic strings and gradually introduce special characters and quantifiers.
Use Testing Tools: Rubular and Regex101 make it easier to see real-time results.
Learn Core Components: Focus on understanding character classes (\d, \w), anchors (^, $), quantifiers (*, +, {}), and grouping (()).
